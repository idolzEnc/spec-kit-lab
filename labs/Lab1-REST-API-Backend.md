# 🏰 Lab 1: The Library at the End of the World

## Building a REST API Backend with GitHub Spec Kit

### Overview

In this lab, you will forge a **REST API** using **OpenAPI (Swagger) 3.0.1** specification as the backend for a text-based adventure game. You will use **GitHub Spec Kit** to drive the development process through specifications.

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Technologies:**

- Language: **C#** or **TypeScript** (your choice)
- API Specification: **OpenAPI 3.0.1**
- Development Methodology: **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have:

- [ ] Git installed and configured
- [ ] Node.js (v18+) or .NET SDK (8.0+) installed
- [ ] **Visual Studio Code** installed
- [ ] **GitHub Copilot** extension installed and activated in VS Code
- [ ] Python 3.8+ with `uv` package manager (for Spec Kit CLI)

---

## Step 1: Install GitHub Spec Kit CLI

First, install the `specify-cli` tool globally:

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install the Spec Kit CLI
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# Verify installation
specify version

# Check available tools and AI agents
specify check
```

---

## Step 2: Initialize Your Project

Create a new Spec Kit project for the adventure game API:

```bash
# Initialize with GitHub Copilot
specify init adventure-api --ai copilot

# Navigate to your project
cd adventure-api
```

This creates:

- `specs/` directory for feature specifications
- `memory/` directory for project context
- `scripts/` directory with automation scripts
- Agent-specific configuration files

---

## 💬 Using Spec Kit Commands in VS Code

All `/speckit.*` commands are executed through the **GitHub Copilot Chat panel** in VS Code:

1. **Open the Chat Panel**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+I` (Mac), or click the Copilot icon in the sidebar
2. **Type the command**: Enter the `/speckit.*` command followed by your description
3. **Press Enter**: Copilot will process the command and generate the appropriate files
4. **Review the output**: Check the generated specifications and approve any file changes

> **💡 Tip:** Make sure you have the project folder open in VS Code before running commands. The commands work on the current workspace.

---

## Step 3: Establish Project Constitution (Principles)

Define the guiding principles for your API:

```
/speckit.constitution Create principles for a text adventure game REST API:
- Security first: All endpoints must be authenticated
- RESTful design: Follow REST conventions strictly
- Documentation clarity: Every endpoint must be documented in OpenAPI 3.0.1
- Testability: Every feature must have unit tests
- Simplicity: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Performance: Response time under 200ms for all endpoints
```

---

## Step 4: Implement Features Using Spec Kit Workflow

For each feature, follow the complete Spec Kit workflow:

1. **Specify** → Create the feature specification
2. **Plan** → Generate implementation plan
3. **Tasks** → Break down into actionable tasks
4. **Implement** → Execute the implementation

> **⚠️ Important:** Complete the full workflow for each feature before moving to the next one. This ensures each feature is fully implemented and tested before building dependent features.

| 2     | Dice System          | Foundation for combat mechanics |
| 3     | Adventure System     | Core game structure             |
| 4     | Character Management | Depends on adventures           |
| 5     | Inventory System     | Depends on characters           |
| 6     | Combat System        | Depends on dice, characters     |
| 7     | Quest System         | Depends on all previous         |

## Step 5: Generate OpenAPI Documentation

After all features are implemented, ensure your OpenAPI specification is complete:

```bash
# For TypeScript with tsoa
npm run swagger

# For C# - Swagger is auto-generated at runtime
# Access at: http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Your Implementation

### Run Tests

```bash
# TypeScript
npm test

# C#
dotnet test
```

### Verify OpenAPI Specification

Ensure your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file:

- Uses version 3.0.1
- Documents all endpoints
- Includes request/response schemas
- Has authentication requirements defined

### Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Start your server
npm run dev  # TypeScript
dotnet run   # C#

# Test with curl or use the Swagger UI
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "adventurer", "password": "quest123"}'
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with the Dice Engine** - It's foundational for combat
2. **Design your OpenAPI spec early** - Let it guide implementation
3. **Test as you go** - Don't leave testing until the end
4. **Keep security simple** - Basic JWT is sufficient
5. **Document clearly** - Good API docs help everyone
